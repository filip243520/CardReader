First version of this project is like in a half working condition and half swedish so like if you somehow find this then goodluck interpreting any of the comments or some words. The basic function is to be able to take the presence of students by only scanning a device.

Project has been updated with some new functions, separating the register function to give it a cleaner look as well as adding some dummy users. I have also added more graphical changes as well as some general QoL changes in order to make it more accessable and easier to use during my upcoming demo. A logo will be added later during the day.
